# LiRi

## Description

Welcome to my LiRi bot. LiRi is like iPhone's Siri, however, it is a *Language* Interpretaion and Recognition interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

## Instructions

To search for a song through the Spotify API, type into the command line:

    node liri.js spotify-this-song <song title here>

To search for an upcoming show through the Bands in Town API, type into the command line:

    node liri.js concert-this <artist name here>

To search for a movie through the OMDB API, type into the command line:

    node liri.js movie-this <movie name>

Using the fs Node package, use this command to take the text inside of random.txt using one of LiRi's commands:

    node liri.js do-what-it-says
